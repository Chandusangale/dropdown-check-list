With version 1.0, I have purposefully changed the directory and build structure of
the project to hopefully make it clearer about which components are part of the
build, and to keep the documentation (tied to the current release) separate from
the rest of the widget source (which may be under active development).

1)	The documentation page has been removed from 'src' and included in its own
	'doc' directory. The 'doc' directory includes its own copies of the components
	needed to render the documentation html page and is no longer tied directly to
	the version active in 'src'. This means that changes can be made in 'src' as 
	part of pending development, but the on-line documentation will continue to
	reflect the released version.
	
	The 'testing' page within the doc directory references the active, non-minimized
	component within source.  This allows you to use the testing page to check on
	work-in-progress.
	
2)	The 'src' directory now contains the bare minimum needed to support the widget.
	But it does include the jQuery support libraries explicitly named with the
	appropriate versions.

3)	References to generic versions of jQuery and jQuery-ui have been replaced
	with explicit callouts to those versions used in development and testing.
	
3)	A 'releases' directory has been included within SVN to support a history of
	release zip files that are created.
	
4)	The build.xml script has been changed to include the 'doc' directory and to
	construct a min.js that is named with the target version.
	
	
Development for a new release:

1)	Leave the 'doc' and its corresponding .zip file alone while you are in active
	development of the new release.
	You can use the testing page as your test environment.
	
2)	Document your changes in 'src/changes.txt'

3)	You can check your work-in-progress changes into SVN within the 'src' 
	directory. But do NOT touch the core 'doc' until you are ready for a new release.

3)	When you are ready to cut the new release:
	a)	Update the version number in build.xml
	b)	Update the version number in the version function in the main .js
	c)	Use ANT to create the new release 'dist' directory and new zip file
	
3)	MANUALLY copy the latest ui.dropdownchecklist.js and ui.dropdownchecklist-X.X-min.js into
	the 'doc' directory.
	
	**** IMPORTANT ****
		At this point, the uncompressed and minimized .js files in the 'doc' section of 
		the .zip file is out of date.
		
		In the .zip file, the 'js' and 'src' directories are correct.  
		
		Therefore, once you have done the manual copy back into 'doc', 
			*** RERUN THE ANT SCRIPT *** 
		to generate a newer .zip file that includes new components in the 'doc' directory.
	**** IMPORTANT ****
	
4)	MANUALLY copy the generated .zip file into the 'releases' directory.  It should have
	its own name and not conflict with anything already present.
	
5)	If the on-line documentation needs to change, update 'dropdownchecklist.html'

6)	Check your changes into SVN

7)	Update the google code project page with the new release
